## Installation

1. I recommend [zplugin](https://github.com/zdharma/zplugin) to load lazily.

    ```zsh
    # Wait 1s to load
    zplugin ice wait'1'
    zplugin light 'sei40kr/zsh-tmux-rename'
    ```

1. You can also use [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug).

    ```zsh
    zplug 'sei40kr/zsh-tmux-rename'
    ```

## Requirements

* **unused** vcs_info
    Loaded automatically, but make sure that other plugins don't use it. (especially prompt plugins)

## TODO

* [ ] Update preview to make clear what this plugin does.
